#### Description:

The Stock Portfolio Tracker is a versatile Python project designed to empower users in monitoring and managing their stock investments. This financial tool offers a comprehensive set of features that enable users to efficiently track their stock portfolio, retrieve historical stock data, calculate investment values, and assess the total value of their stock holdings. Whether you're a novice or an experienced investor, this application provides valuable insights and aids in making informed financial decisions.

## Key Features

### Fetching Stock Data

- Users can easily access historical stock data by providing a stock symbol, start date, and end date.
- The application leverages the `yfinance` library to fetch accurate and up-to-date stock information from Yahoo Finance, ensuring reliability and data integrity.

### Calculating Investment Value

- For individual stocks in the portfolio, users can calculate the total investment value by specifying the number of shares they own.
- The application retrieves the latest stock price, allowing users to make informed investment decisions by understanding the current value of their holdings.

### Tracking Stocks in Portfolio

- Users can maintain a comprehensive record of multiple stocks in their portfolio.
- For each stock, they input the stock symbol, the quantity of shares owned, the start date, and the end date. This data is used to calculate and store the total investment value for each stock.

### Calculating Total Portfolio Value

- The application enables users to assess the cumulative value of their entire stock portfolio.
- By summing up the total investment values of all the stocks in the portfolio, users gain a holistic view of the financial performance of their investments.

## The project consists of two main files:

- `project.py`: This file contains the core functionality of the Stock Portfolio Tracker. It includes functions for fetching stock data, calculating investment values, tracking stocks in the portfolio, editing the socks and calculating the total portfolio value. The main function allows users to interact with the application via a console-based menu.

- `test_project.py`: This file includes unit tests for the core functions of the Stock Portfolio Tracker. The tests are implemented using the `pytest` framework and help ensure the correctness of the project's functionality.
